# career-guidance
From birth to old age, proper career counseling is critical in molding one's life path. We all know that we live in a highly competitive era where people must compete in every aspect of their lives in order to achieve their ultimate goal. A thorough and comprehensive career advice approach is the only precise alternative that will offer you the desired aim in the present period of globalization when we have endless career options. People frequently face the issue of narrowing down the best option when faced with various possibilities and options in their professions. 
This problem is not only faced by the students at the high school level but also faced by students at the undergraduate  level where students are often confused about which career to choose among the vast options available in the market .Even graduate students are confused about the available career options, whether to pursue higher studies or rather go for job.
Making the right career decision at the right time makes a lot of difference. Hence career guidance/counselling plays a very important role in shaping the future of every individual.
To solve this problem, all we need is comprehensive career guidance from the start of any academic career.  This web application aims at providing the best career guidance with the right means to  achieve their goal by taking into consideration the students' abilities in academics, hobbies, skills, knowledge, interests and technicalities. A student at the school level/ graduate level/undergraduate level can use this application to find the right career based on their interests and skills .
To be more specific with the options being offered we divide the users into 3 divisions:

  1)After Secondary school
  2)After Higher Secondary
  3)After Graduation

The youth of the country will have wider perspective and increased clarity on the available career options at each step of their life. Once the user dives beyond their originally-anticipated scope with the help of a career counsellor, new doors become open. 
The solution adopted will play a major role from helping the candidates in crafting the strategy that suits them to help them in executing it correctly in the journey of the candidates.
More than all else, there is a great benefit in having someone (counsellor) along the way to provide the candidate with support and the confidence that they require.
Life is incomplete if you have great career success, but not career satisfaction. By providing the right career advice based on the candidates' interests, skills, technicalities and knowledge, we aim to bring career satisfaction to every individual .
